# Problem-solving
## Arrays
1) Implement a function which takes as input an array and a key, and updates the array so
that all occurrences of the input key have been removed and the remaining elements have been
shifted left to fill the emptied indices. Return the number of remaining elements. There are no
requirements as to the values stored beyond the last valid element.

'''python 
def delete_key(A, key):  # [2,1,2,3],[1,1,2,3]
    c = 0
    for i in range(len(A)):
        if A[i] == key:
            A[i] = A[i + 1]
            c += 1
    return len(A) - c
